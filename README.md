1. System of Equations – Finding the Equation of a Parabola
Create a script that will:
• Ask the user for three sets of (x,y) coordinates that a parabola passes through.
• Solve a system of equations to determine the coefficients a, b, and c for the equation for the parabola
𝑦 = 𝑎x^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐
• Display the equation for that parabola on the screen
• Graph the parabola AND the three points that the user entered on the same plot for values of x from -10 to 10.
o Include a title and grid for the plot
For example, if the user entered the coordinates (-2,0), (1,6), and (3,20), that would set up a system of equations:
0 = 4𝑎 − 2𝑏 + 𝑐
6 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐
20 = 9𝑎 + 3𝑏 + 𝑐
The solution to that system is 𝑎 = 1, 𝑏 = 3, 𝑐 = 2.
So, the equation for the parabola is 𝑦 = 𝑥2 + 3𝑥 + 2 and the graph would look like this.
